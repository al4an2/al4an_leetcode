# LeetCode Practice

This repo is just a lightweight journal of interview/LeetCode problems. Keep it simple:

- Put every solution in the `tasks/` folder, one file per problem so it is easy to find later.
- At the top of each file leave a short note with the original task link (e.g., `# https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/`) to remember the source and reread the statement fast.

That’s all—use any language you want, just keep the files inside `tasks/` and include the reference link for each problem.
