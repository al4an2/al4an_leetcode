# LeetCode Practice

A lightweight journal of LeetCode/LeetCode-style problems.

- One file per problem in `tasks/` for easy lookup.
- Filenames match the LeetCode task titles.
- If a filename doesn’t match, I drop a quick note with the original link so I can jump back to the statement fast.
- I plan to add brief descriptions to some problems soon.
